# ElectronicBookCatalog
   The main objective of the project is to create an online bookstore that allows users to search and purchase a book online based on title, author and subject. The selected books are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their books online through credit card payment. Using this Website, the user can purchase a book online instead of going out to a bookstore and wasting time. 
    
   There are many online bookstores like Powell’s, Amazon which were designed using Html. I want to develop a similar website using Apache Tomcat7, MySQL Server. Online Book store is an online web application where the customer can purchase books online. Through a web browser the customers can search for a book by its title or author, later can add to the shopping cart and finally purchase using credit card transaction. The user can login using his account details or new customers can set up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name, contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a book by giving ratings on a score of five. The books are divided into many categories based on subject like Software, Database, English, Architecture etc.
